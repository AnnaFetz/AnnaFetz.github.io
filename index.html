		<small>Project's scope, intersects the Event domain with the University Student Life within Trentino's area. Due to the placement of University of Trento's deartments, the spatial coverage includes only the municipalities of Trento and Rovereto. <br>
		Temporally, the project targets 2019-2022 timespan, which aims at detecting and modeling the changes occurred due to the Covid-19 pandemic in event organization and participation.<br>
		The final deliverable should correspond to a website acting as a collective memory of a specific administrative area. The target users are university students, who interact with the service,<br>
		standing as both <i>short-term memory</i> (i.e., working memory) and <i>long-term memory</i>, specifically episodic. While the former function filters the future events by location, duration, target age, personal interests, event category (e.g., music, shows, festivals),<br>
		and secondary attributes (e.g., language, price), the latter retrieves relevant information about past events. This option focuses mainly on the event's description, tags, ranking, comments, and pictures. <br><br></small>

        Data regarding events coming from crushsite, stayhappening, tripadvisor, dati trentino, meetup, mymovies and ESN have been saved in JSON format, and divided by E-type.
        Their keys are data and object properties contained in the respective EG Model.<br>Namely, they are shaped according to the E-type they belong to, as <span style="color: #0c9e95"></span>Cultural Events</span> example below.

        The building process of the ER was intended to resemble a real query on the final service. Thus, below an explanation of the intended hierarchy. <br>

        <p>EG DESCRIPTION:</p>
		<p><li> Common objects were mainly considered to be existence-independent as they are
		uniquely identified by their attributes, and do not depend on other entity. Thanks to their
		generic representation and vast usage, they could be used for a (future) broader DoI.</li><br>
		<li> Core objects represent purpose-specific entities, such as the event type, main actors (e.g.,
		Student) or specific facilities. According to the intended output, core objects mirror the
		infrastructure of the filtering system of the website. Specifically, these entities should direct
		the initial query and skim all the events not matching preferences. For instance, if a specific
		place is selected, the output will list only events taking place there.</li><br>
		<li> Contextual objects were thought of being a further specification provided by the user to
		obtain a narrower list of events matching all criteria. For instance, the user would use
		location-specific keywords when searching for a specific set of events (e.g., Concerts in
		Trento's Doss).</li><br>
		<li>With concerns to actions, they mostly were intentionally not defined as entities. They have been integrated as either properties or bidirectional relationships between main
		entities (i.e., superclasses). This choice is justified by focusing more on the event types and,
		consequently, rejecting of a dense ER model. On the one hand, this leads to a model that
		fully matches the project's purpose. On the other hand, it implies a more complex matching between the ER model and an already­existing Ontology. Functions, representing a
		role or a static nature of an Etype, were mostly integrated as properties. However, in modeling certain events, this representation does not hold and the creation of sub­entities is preferred.</li><br>
		<br>
		The designed Entit-Relationship (ER) model, shown below 1, exploits the Crow's foot notation
		by displaying entities as boxes and relationships as lines between them [6]. The relationship's
		cardinality is defined by the shape at the end of the lines: a ring for zero, a dash for one and
		crow's foot for many.
		Moreover, the model structures the entities following a bottom-up approach, called generalization. If a set of entities has some common properties, they are extracted and generalized to a
		higher-level entity (i.e., Student and Employee are generalized to Person). A sub-class inherits
		all the attributes and relationships from the superclass(es) and, additionally, defines its specific
		attributes. A non filled arrow is placed with the head touching the superclass object, while all
		sub-classes are linked to this arrow by a black line.
		<br>
		The ER model has been structured following the future website's filters and its focus on searching for events, as other websites already do (Figure 2 and 3). The main event's type (i.e.,
		categories) identified are the following:
	
		<li>Social Events: lead to a socialization process (i.e., people forming groups) and present
		repeated actions, such as drinking or dancing. A prototypical example is a Happy Hour.</li><br>
		<li>Education Events: (academic) prearranged meetings for consultation, exchange of information, or discussion. The audience might be not actively involved.</li><br>
		<li>Workshop: umbrella term for any laboratory event that actively involves the participants
		and delivers a tangible result (i.e., product), or breaks new skills.</li><br>
		<li>Cultural Events: knowing that cultural has a broad meaning, within this project, an event
		is defined as cultural if it is designed for entertainment and enjoyment and is related to
		some branch of art, culture, or local values (i.e., performing arts, musicals, photography,
		and literature). The definition here adopted partially resembles the DutchCulture Database
		structure as it is consistent with the project's purpose.</li><br>
		<li>Tour: traveling means going from one place to another. Whereas the event's types above
		may be represented as happening at a specific time and in a static space, a tour event
		involves both a movement and some personal interests. For example, if a hiking tour is
		considered, two decoupled levels can be identified. Firstly, the static one, meaning the
		event description, follows the standard place-time definition. Then, the movement and its
		volatility can be introduced. Thus, creating a specific entity in the ER model combines the
		two levels and tries to solve a corner case.</li><br>
		<li>Sports Events: organized occasions where a sports or exercise activity is performed at
		a specific location in a temporal interval. Most sports events are also part of bigger meetings and competitions. They can be periodically organised, such as the Facoltiadi or a sports course (i.e., dance course). Depending on the disciplines, schedule, competitors,
		and scope (e.g., tournaments, leagues, fundraising), the events may embed different descriptors. However, accordingly to the project's purpose only the general ones have been
		chosen. Specifically, they resemble the SportsCompetition model developed by the W3C Community Group.
		
		While the Covid-19 pandemic did not particularly impact the events' categories, it constraints
		and modifies the concept of location. Thus, three scenarios are possible:
		<li>Offline events have a location traditionally defined as an identifiable point in the two (or
		three) dimensional space </li><br>
		<li>Online events, meaning occasions happening only in a virtual environment hosted on video
		communication services, such as Zoom and Google Meet.</li><br>
		<li>Blended or Hybrid events offer an offline or online attendance depending on the participant's
		needs and possibilities.</li><br> 
		<br>
		CreativeWork gathers all human artifacts produced during an activity or employed in an event. The properties for each sub-class have been extracted by benchmarking other services, for example:
		<li>Track follows the audio features returned by the SpotifyAPI.</li><br>
		<li>Recipe is mainly modeled on Giallo Zafferano, a well known Italian food website and magazine that greatly satisfies user's needs but does not offer tabular data. Further attributes
		were extracted from the RecipeDB food database, which encapsulates the information
		about recipes, ingredients and nutrition profiles interlinked with flavor profiles and health
		associations. </li><br>
		<li>Map should comply with some standards and minimum requirements depending on the type
		of product, as the Copernicus program states. In this framework, the maps are defined as
		a geographical depiction of the territory and routing instrument. </li><br>
		

		<li>Image entity preserves the standard characteristics of a (digital) picture but also mimics Pinterest's functionality via (optional) tags, allowing an easy retrieval.</li><br>
		
		<li>PerformingGroup is an umbrella term for describing single artists, groups, bands, or orchestras but also theater or artistic groups. </li><br>
		<li>Secondly, the Team sub-entity is based on the tabularstructure of TheSportsDB by leaving out the attributes referring to streaming data (e.g., live scores).
		</li><br>
		<li>To satisfy the necessity of a memory, the ER model integrates an Archive entity too, aiming at keeping track of events' past history.</li><br>
		<li> A final remark regards the creation of the ArchitecturalBarriers entity that enlarges the plethora of users and increases the quality of the final service. The information delivered focuses
			on the event's venue (and transport) and its accessibility. Due to the lack of standardization in this field, these properties comply with the Italian legislation DM 236/89. </li><br>

		<b>PLEASE NOTICE THAT DUE TO TIMING, SOME FURTHER CHANGES WERE APPLIED ON THE ER, HENCE, THIS IS THE REFERENCE ONE: </b></small>
        <a href="https://github.com/AnnaFetz/AnnaFetz.github.io/blob/main/photo_2021-12-03_18-18-40.jpg"> FINAL ER </a>
        <br>
        <p>ETG DESCRIPTION:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Event:</b> The CQs requiring to navigate back in time through an event's collective memory (i.e.,
                Archive) and those demanding the distance to a certain venue were not satisfied by the
                previous version of the ER model. While the latter has been solved via a boolean Data
                property distance that filters the events based on a ray of 2km from a specific venue, the
                former issue induced more structural changes. Hence the adjustments focused on the
                consistency of information and the storage costs of sub events belonging to a super event,
                such as a Festival or a Fair. To simplify the model, the Object property superEvent has
                been introduced, allowing a one to one relationship with the main Event and guaranteeing a single storage in Archive. Moreover, to follow the trail of a collective memory, and
                to ease future project's expansions, the Object property post was introduced, linking to
                CreativeWork, and modeling the act of posting pictures and reviews.
                Within this framework, also the Object property EventType and the relative sub categories
                have undergone several modifications. Ideally, the ER event classification model should
                have been mirrored by the final ETG, as it perfectly satisfied the granularity required by the
                CQs. However, due to the fact that the majority of our reference files required pondered
                parsing, and several Event's leaf nodes contained boolean properties, a less detailed but
                more performing option has been preferred. Thus, the ETG reflects the final ER model,
                that merges the contextual and core event-related Etypes and keeps the six main subcategories of Event. Hence, the Event child SocialEvent displays all the Data properties
                contained in DanceEvent (e.g., happyHour) and in FolkEvent.
                Lastly, instead of keeping one Entity per event mode (namely, offline, online, and blended),
                a new attribute eventMode was introduced. The values allowed should identify (as string)
                the three event statuses: online, offline, hybrid. This simplification skims some relationships
                between event and location, and retains the most relevant information.</li>
            <li><b>Duration: </b>The Object property duration, contained in Event, was also subject to changes. Thus, the
                 concept of Duration has been simplified and reduced to the Data Properties start and
                  end, which define the Event's range of action in time.</li> 
            <li><b>Schedule:</b> Due to the overlapping of Schedule with Event, it has been replaced by two Data properties:
            recurrency and schedule, respectively defined as boolean datatype and string. The latter
            should specify the pace of the Event, guaranteeing both an appropriate output for CQs
            requiring weekly or yearly scheduled events, and for those having an irregular pace.</li>
            <li>><b>Facility: </b>A trade off was faced: on the one hand, facilities could be categorized in sub classes, such
            as FoodEstablishment or Accommodation, keeping a high level of detail. On the other hand,
            this structure was not feasible due to the time required in data preparation and management. Therefore, all boolean Data properties of the sub­classes have been merged within
            facilityType property. Additionally, considering the CQs' requirement of listing specific
            food (e.g., typicalFood) or activity (e.g., hiking), the contextual attributes have been kept
            in separate Data properties. Hence, Facility presents properties such as cuisine and
            hiking. This latter example also solved the issue regarding the erasure of Landscape, that
            was requiring a granularity out of project's scope.</li>
            <li><b>Ranking: </b>In Ranking, the isDistant property was discarded in light of what discussed for Event
            and data availability. Thus, instead of keeping both dichotomies distance ranking and
            enjoyment ranking, only the latter has been kept. Moreover, the ER model was lacking
            the connection between the concept of ranking and the criterion followed, namely the reviews. To fill this gap, the Object property review was introduced in Ranking and linked to
            Review, a contextual and independent entity.</li>
            
            <li><b>Archive: </b>Due to the concept of collective memory pursued by the Purpose, some changes were
            applied on the Etype Archive as it was missing some information. Thus, the hyperlinks
            created by hashtags, the importDate and the visualReferences were added as Data properties.</li>
            <li><b>CreativeWork: </b> The changes regarding Review addressed a further issue: several children of CreativeWork
            were sharing properties and the available data would not have reached such granularity. Thus, all the common properties of CreativeWork's children have been collapsed
            and the children (i.e., Image, Show, Recipe, Track and Map) discarded. The super entity
            CreativeWork is therefore defined as a ”manifestation of creative effort including fine artwork (sculpture, paintings, drawing, sketching, performance art), dance, writing (literature)
            film-making, and composition".</li>
            <li><b>Note: </b>Further entities, such as SeatReservation, Transport and PostalAddress have been
            deleted as such granularity was not expected. Moreover, the information required by
            some CQs has been either collapsed in the super­entities (e.g., PostalAddress moved
            in Location), or added as data properties (i.e., trasportationMode) or integrated within
            already existing properties, like additionalInformation or description.
            When selecting the appropriate concepts to reshape the ER model, some general purpose ontologies such as schema.org and DBPedia have been exploited, along with Wordnet
            database. Moreover, the concepts related to the spatial information have been treated according to OpenStreetMap's ontologies OSMonto and LikedGeoData. A last open issue regards
            the definition of architectural barriers, which depends on the country and its relative legislation.
            Having as spatial coverage the area of Trento and Rovereto, the project reports the guidelines
            proposed by the cooperative HandiCREA in the mobile application TrentinoAccessibile.</li>
